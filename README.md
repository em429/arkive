### A private read-it-later with link-rot protection

Arkive saves your articles and keeps them readable â€” it submits your pages to the Internet Archive and extracts the main content so you never lose a resource again.

It's a read-it-later meets web archiver, with the mandatory responsive UI so you can catch up on your archive on the toilet as well.

There is an API endpoint to submit links as well. Why? So you can set up a shortcut for the 'Share' dialog on Android using the app HTTP Shortcuts (or something similar) and archive webpages with two taps.
