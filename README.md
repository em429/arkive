# Arkive: A private web archive

Arkive is a marriage of three ideas: bookmarking, archiving (mirroring) and read-it-later. Let's see what appeals to me from each, and why I thought a merge is necessary for my purposes.

* Bookmarks appeal is easy organization and that they are easy to add stuff to
  - The downsides are: linkrot, sync is not solved
* (Offsite) Archving's appeal is protecting from linkrot and backing up
  - The downside: not private, usually lacks organizational options 
* Read-it-later's appeal is not forgetting interesting articles and removing visual disturbances, ads ..etc
  - The downside: linkrot, at the whim of a third-party, hard to sync w bookmarks


Arkive is designed to solve all these problems at once.
